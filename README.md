Getting familiar with Arduino


# Planning
## In what form?
- watch
- glove
- forearm guard
- hat
- shirt

I think hat might be a good option.
Forearm guard is the coolest option in my opinion. (like the one Buzz Lightyear has)
But people move around there arm alot through out the day. I'm not sure how I'd design the part so that no matter how the arm is rotated, the device is at a fixed position or fixed to the arm.
A hat in the other hand, doesn't move much. And it has pretty good surface area to put all the parts attached to.

## What features?
I want all the features I can possible use.
I have UNO R3 Most Complete Starter Kit and I want to use every single parts available to me.
